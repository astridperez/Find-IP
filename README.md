# Find-IP
Network Automation program

As part of a collaborative team, I undertook a project to design and develop a Python interface that enables automatic connection to a network. This interface not only provides a comprehensive visual representation of the network's structure but also facilitates data storage in databases and streamlines network automation processes using Python, SQL, and various networking technologies.

## Features

- **Visual Network Representation:** The interface offers a visual representation of the network's structure, helping users better understand its layout and relationships.
- **Data Storage:** Network data is efficiently stored in databases, allowing for organized and easy retrieval of information.
- **Network Automation:** The interface streamlines network automation processes, making tasks such as configuration management more efficient.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- SQL
- Tkinter
- pandas
- networkx
- matplotlib
- netmiko

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/astridperez/Find-IP`
2. Set up the necessary environment (e.g., create a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda`).
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the Python script to launch the network automation interface.
2. Use the interface to automatically connect to a network, visualize its structure, and manage configurations.
